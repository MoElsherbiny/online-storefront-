# Project Name

Storefront Backend

# Description

The company stakeholders want to create an online storefront to showcase their great product ideas. Users need to be able to browse an index of all products, see the specifics of a single product, and add products to an order that they can view in a cart page.

## Installation

To install all of the packages in a pack.json,
use
npm install

## Usage

npm run dev to run the server with nodemon package
npm run build to configure Ts with JavaScript
npm run format to check prettier
npm run lint:fix to check for errorsÂ and, if possible, fix them
npm run migrate-up
try testing using one of the fantastic packages, Jasmine.
npm run test

## Migrations

create your dev postgres database
and your test postgres database
here is the way to do that in command line or terminal
CREATE DATABASE ..dev..;
CREATE DATABASE ..test..;

Then the Migrations work
use
npm run migrate-up
or
db-migrate up
